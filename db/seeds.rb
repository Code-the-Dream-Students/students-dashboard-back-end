#     rails new <project-name>
#     cd <project-name>
#     git init
#     On github, create a new empty repository. It should be public and should have no README.md
#     Copy the URL for the new repository, and then on your workspace do:
#     git remote add origin <git-repository-url>
#     git add -A
#     git commit -m “first commit”
#     git push -u origin master
    
#     As you develop your application, you should create a feature branch for each feature, using
    
#     git checkout -b <feature-name>
    
#     and then when it is complete, do:
    
#     git add -A
#     git commit -m “feature-name”
#     git push origin <feature-name>
    
#     Then on the git repository, do a pull request, verify it, and merge your own pull request into the master. Then start the next feature with this sequence:
    
#     git checkout master
#     git pull origin master
#     git checkout -b <new-feature>",
