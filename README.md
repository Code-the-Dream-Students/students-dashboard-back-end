This is a test of our real application in Ruby on Rails. For this project, we are going to use PostgreSQL. It is recommended to set up Postgres on your computer, and also on Ruby on Rails.

Do not push or pull request to master. Create your own branch and push your branch to the repository. This in order to know that the application works on all computers using different operating systems.

To set up the application, once you have the clone on your computer, run:

* `bundle install`
* `rails db:create` to set up postgres database
* `rails db:migrate`
* `rails db:seed` to feed the data base
* `rails s`

It should run and show the following on `localhost:3000`:
